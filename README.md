There are two programs here.

First, spellchecker.py. This is a gui program that reads a file of words (dict.txt), and then prompts the user for an input file to check the spelling of.

Second, a short demo program that lets the user work with a hash table. It was written to give a simple implementation of a hash table so that anyone looking at the code can see how they work in java.
